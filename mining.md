hey all, had several requests for a mining channel. here you go
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:14 AM
Sweet
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:14 AM
i currently mine with an antminer l3+, and 3 gpus
happy to answer any questions anyone has
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:15 AM
There's 2 types of mining IMHO. one is cloud mining and hardware mining(?) is that what you called
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:18 AM
I suppose that's correct. Although cloud mining is hardware mining,  you just don't own the hardware
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:18 AM
i’ve never been profitable on cloud mining.  however, i haven’t tried all of them
cloud mining you’re renting the hardware basically
Zerocool - Last Saturday at 1:19 AM
What coin(s) are you guys mining?
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:20 AM
which is great, in concept.  however, i tried quite bit of it and i could buy the coins cheaper than mining them
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:20 AM
ATM I'm mining TRZ
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:20 AM
i only tried litecoin though
i’m mining litecoin with my antminer and straight btc with nicehash on my gpus
i’ve found that nicehash is by far the most profitable gpu mining
nicehash legacy, to be exact
you can use that btc to buy the alt coins if you want them
i used to use my antminer on nicehash too, but since the hack, it’s not been as profitable as pool mining litecoin
Zerocool - Last Saturday at 1:24 AM
So with hardware mining, is it setting up a beast cpu and letting it run 24/7? (Mining noob here!)
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:25 AM
Nah it's GPU's that do all the work.  (graphics cards)
But yeah,  letting it run 24/7
ROI is terrible with power prices in Australia
I approach it differently
Zerocool - Last Saturday at 1:26 AM
Ohhh , like the Nvidia cards right
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:27 AM
Yes that's right
I mine the shit coins that I get the most per 24hr in hope one day they moon(edited)
thinks2
Nova - Last Saturday at 1:27 AM
im not personally a miner, but here's some mining profitability rankings: https://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:29 AM
Whattomine.com is a good one. Enter the cards you have and it give results
Zerocool - Last Saturday at 1:30 AM
Smart! @BlackXantus
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:31 AM
the thing is with mining cheap coins, you can just mine and get btc. then buy more of those cheap coins than you could get by mining them
that’s what i’ve found
i have 2 1080ti and 1 1070.  they’re all fully paid off by mining
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:32 AM
Yeah true.  I only have 1 1070, it's just for fun
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:32 AM
the beauty of nicehash is that it’s easy to set up, good client, and fully automated to switch to the highest paying coin
even a 1070 can give you enough btc to play with
that btc gains value as time goes on, it all adds up
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:33 AM
i only have 1 1060 3 gb.
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:33 AM
even if you only make 50 bucks a month
1060 makes like 40 bucks a month or so i think
it’s just sitting there, might as well mine with it
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:33 AM
but should i consider about the wear and tear?
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:33 AM
that’s how i feel.  “free” money
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:34 AM
ok imma go look up nice hash then
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:34 AM
honestly, i don’t.  you’ll get full roi before it dies, unless it’s going to die anyway
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:34 AM
1 question, if i stop like 2-3 weeks mining, will it like clear my money off? i assume nice hash is like a pool
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:34 AM
use the nicehash legacy version, if you’re familiar with a regular pc app
it collects in the nicehash wallet
which, recently got hacked. however, they’re beefing up their security and paying back the money that got stolen (hopefully) so whatever.
you can move your bitcoin off when you want

this is my average for the past 24 hrs
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:37 AM
Actually,  just looked. I have mined $90 worth of TZR in 9 days off my one 1070
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:37 AM
that's cool
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:37 AM
so 10 bucks a day is good
what app/pool are you using @princze1
i was mining vtc for a while, but nicehash was paying out more
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:38 AM
long back, i used ethmine or something. i stopped, and it was wiped off. cause i was on holiday for 2 weeks.
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:39 AM
Yeah,  now that Trz has gone up,  I'm mining half the coins per day for last 2 days
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:39 AM

i look at this and compare what i’m doing
the thing is, those top ones change so quickly, it doesn’t make it worth mining them consistently
difficulty changes briefly and then it goes back before you can benefit
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:41 AM
wouldn't it auto change for u? depends on which is profitable
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:41 AM
@lustigio right.  so, what i do is take that btc i get and throw it into some cojns that are pumping or give it to crypto for the fund and then it makes even more money
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:42 AM
Yeah sweet
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:42 AM
nicehash does for you.  there are some sites that do it for you, but i’ve bot had much luck with them.  i end up making less and it’s more hassle in the long run.  it’s so simple to just get paid out in btc and then you’re free to do whatever you want with it
even pay membership fees lol
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:43 AM

this is not the legacy one right
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:44 AM
that’s the regular one.  it pays out slightly less but it’s easier to use
legacy really isn’t difficult to use though
legacy has more options
which equals more payout
princze1 - Last Saturday at 1:44 AM
oh? they pays out differently?thanks, i'll check it out
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:45 AM
for sure
lustigio - Last Saturday at 1:46 AM
Thanks @BlackXantus
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 1:47 AM
np, anytime.
mining is what finally got me started in crypto after me saying it was nonsense for so long
i just bought a gaming rig and decided to give it a try
fell in love with everything about crypto
stellar2
princze1 - Last Saturday at 2:04 AM
Ok just started. Let's see.
@BlackXantus did you configure fan speed and the cpu/ gpu configuration?
CoinWhisperer (UNIFY shill) - Last Saturday at 2:14 AM
Does anyone here cloud mine?
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 2:16 AM
@princze1 full speed!
keep things as cool as possible
you can under clock the gpus to keep them cool too
@CoinWhisperer (UNIFY shill) tried it, i didn’t come out profitable. was cheaper to buy coins with btc than to mine them
i haven’t tried the annual plans though
CoinWhisperer (UNIFY shill) - Last Saturday at 2:19 AM
Ahhh, ive seen other discussions where you automatically reinvest the profits to mining and they claim it to be profitable. It is hard to sieve through the B.S. because all anyone is trying to do is push their referral link.
the cloud mining i am referring to is hashflare
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 2:20 AM
i looked into hashflare
so on the surface it appears to be ok. but do the math
CoinWhisperer (UNIFY shill) - Last Saturday at 2:20 AM
The other alternative and I dont know if it is doable is to spin up a VM on say google cloud platform or AWS
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 2:21 AM
you have to give them btc for 1 year of rental
that btc is going to go up in value or you can invest in the fund
so you then have to make the investment back
and then you have to hope that the mining difficulty doesn’t change (always does)
i couldn’t justify it
i haven’t tried it on google cloud.  really don’t see it being profitable
i could be wrong
i’d rather invest in the fund here
CoinWhisperer (UNIFY shill) - Last Saturday at 2:23 AM
Now that is a much better mining operation haha
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 2:27 AM
no kidding
so if i had to buy an antminer again, i wouldn’t unless i got it in the first batch or 2nd batch where roi is 1 month
difficulty goes way up and it becomes difficult to pay it off
those new baikal miners are really profitable right now, but that won’t last
get them for the 3k and you pay it off in a month
gpu miner rigs are interesting.  the hardware doesn’t lose as much value, so that can be resold if needed.
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 9:36 PM
grabbed another 1080ti today. kinda want to wait for the volta’s to come out before investing too much more in mining.
how are you guys doing that just started to mine?
CryptoZach - Last Saturday at 9:37 PM
Do any of you guys use cloud mining?
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 9:39 PM
@CryptoZach we covered that a bit yesterday.  i’ve tried it and wasn’t profitable enough to make it worth it
it’s possible some coins are profitable,but litecoin was not
CryptoZach - Last Saturday at 9:41 PM
I have been using hashflare for about 5 months, reinvesting all of my payouts into more hashpower and I’ve grown my account from 8.5 TH sha-256 bitcoin mining that I originally purchased to 26TH
Making about $385 a week off of an $1150 initial investment
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 9:42 PM
no shit?
CryptoZach - Last Saturday at 9:42 PM
Seriously
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 9:42 PM
that sounds pretty good
CryptoZach - Last Saturday at 9:42 PM
Want my Refferral link?
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 9:42 PM
no, i already have an account.
i just never bought anything from them
your initial investment is probably worth more now, how much btc was it worth then?
CryptoZach - Last Saturday at 9:45 PM
Shit all the math I did was in dollars because the bitcoin is spent every day.


Because the return is about 300% by using a compound interest calculator you can see how quickly your account will grow
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 9:47 PM
i might give it a whirl.  we’ll see.  with the difficulty rising, i wonder how feasible it is in the long term
CryptoZach - Last Saturday at 9:47 PM
See that was my initial concer
Concern
But a beautiful thing takes place
When the price of BTC drops, the difficulty does as well because other coins become more valuable to mine
Then when BTC rises the difficult rises as well
You get less BTC by the same dollar amount over time
Actually it becomes more efficient as time goes on, the fees from hashflare used to cost 42% of the payout and they are currently at 15%
I’d look into it, there’s nothing better than passive income Imo
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 9:51 PM
for sure
that’s why i have the miners here
they don’t give much
but damn
it’s almost free
haha
adds up
can you up the amount of hash rate at anytime?
start small and add to it, like you said?
@CryptoZach
CryptoZach - Last Saturday at 9:58 PM
Yes sir
You can buy additional mining power at any time
BlackXantus - Last Saturday at 9:58 PM
cool. may try it out. i was skeptical when they want you to sign up for a year and pay up front
CryptoZach - Last Saturday at 9:59 PM
Ya the contracts end after a year but you are constantly buying new ones every day when you reinvest
CryptoZach - Last Saturday at 10:00 PM
I’m considering adding more power to my account now that I have the resources
January 7, 2018
Mikael Rautio - Last Sunday at 2:20 PM
What coin is best to mine on hash flare? Have you made any calculations?
CryptoZach - Last Sunday at 2:22 PM
Yes do you have an account?
BTC is the most profitable followed by ETH,  but I highly recommend you buy BTC and let it reinvest your profits for several months
BlackXantus - Last Sunday at 2:29 PM
yeah, i think BTC is the most profitable right now
from what i’ve seen
Mikael Rautio - Last Sunday at 2:45 PM
No account yet... But I'm looking to get one.
January 9, 2018
Kerry - Yesterday at 6:40 AM
I'm curious, anyone have  referral link?
princze1 - Yesterday at 6:48 AM
may i know what kind of referral link are u looking for?
BlackXantus - Yesterday at 9:37 AM
@Kerry pm’d you
Kerry - Yesterday at 9:47 AM
Thanks
domainplug - Yesterday at 10:11 AM
Does anyone mine gems
January 10, 2018
CoinWhisperer (UNIFY shill) - Today at 6:15 AM
has anyone had any experience between hash flare and genesis?
Kerry - Today at 6:16 AM
check higher in this thread, lots of hashflare chat earlier
I wonder where their servers are?
CoinWhisperer (UNIFY shill) - Today at 6:16 AM
True that
hashflare address says estonia
dont know about their servers though
surely their migrating to vietnam or japan
Kerry - Today at 6:18 AM
get in before they close new accounts :laughing:
CoinWhisperer (UNIFY shill) - Today at 6:18 AM
if they are in china
^
my exact thoughts LOL
bgpublic - Today at 7:09 AM
I have access to power at $0.04 kWh but on a large scale
Anyone want to do mining?
Might be able to get it cheaper
BlackXantus - Today at 9:22 AM
that’s pretty cheap if you’re going to do a larger scale mining rig @bgpublic
CryptoZach - Today at 10:45 AM
@CoinWhisperer (UNIFY shill)  I have used both services for 5 months now and at the end of the day hashflare has  served me munched better, genesis is constantly out of mining contracts and is much more expensive per TH. The only positive with genesis is if you can get your hands on a bitcoin contract they are lifetime
Mikael Rautio - Today at 1:19 PM
@CryptoZach How often do you reinvest you're earnings?
paulm_nl - Today at 1:21 PM
i have a "lifetime" genesis contract. Still not sure it's not Ponzi, but I have a clear return on my investment and steady, daily income
CryptoZach - Today at 1:21 PM
@Mikael Rautio because I started with little money I have been reinvesting every day
That’s for maximum growth, in coming months I’ll be taking 25% of earnings and then reinvest the rest
Gold - Today at 1:26 PM
paulm_nl you've a lifetime or a open contract ?
@CryptoZach Agreed. The only thing I've to complain, to hashflare, was their decision to change contract terms without notice.
CryptoZach - Today at 1:28 PM
Yes back in September when they changed to one year that sucked
@Gold and they have increased the price without warning on 2 occasions, but in the end it’s still very profitable to mine with them, getting about a 315% roi depending on the price of bitcoin
Ive spent a lot of time running mining profit calculations :sweat_smile::sweat_smile:
Gold - Today at 2:08 PM
@CryptoZach it's only worth to buy when BTC price moons. It's the perfect momentum. How much hash? :smiley:
paulm_nl - Today at 3:15 PM
@Gold Lifetime. Has returned the money spent. As would have investing in BTC directly :smile:
But money coming in each and every day so far
Well, to be exact (just looked), it is skipping some days, but the amount has increased.
